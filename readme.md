The whole project helped me glue together everything!
I would still like to do another project very similar to this again to
 reinforce everything.

I liked how I added the category to the object and put it in the database 
as to help me sort it out by category later and display it with the different 
titles using an nf-if on the category.

My styling is getting better!

I still need to master converting it to use services.
